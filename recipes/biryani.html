        <h2> Description </h2>
        <p> Chicken Biryani is a savory chicken and rice dish that includes layers of chicken, rice, and aromatics that are steamed together. 
            The bottom layer of rice absorbs all the chicken juices as it cooks, giving it a tender texture and rich flavor, while the top 
            layer of rice turns out white and fluffy.Buried in the Biryani, you'll find whole cuts of succulent chicken bursting with flavor
            from the potent array of spices, herbs, and aromatics it's marinated in. </p>
